This repository includes:
* the complete gephi file (The City of Ebla.gephi) for the graph published as a preview in Scarpa, E. (2017). _The City of Ebla. A Complete Bibliography of Its Archaeological and Textual Remains_. Venezia (p. 23);
* a second version of the gephi file (The City of Ebla_all labels.gephi), with each node labeled according to its bibliographical reference;
* a high resolution image of the graph published in the book (The City of Ebla_Graph_300dpi.png);

The gephi files will be updated as soon as new references will be added to the online version of the bibliography (upcoming).
